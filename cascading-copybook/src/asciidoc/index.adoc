= Scalable Cobol Copybook Data Processing Using Cascading

== Introduction

Most of the mission-critical applications in enterprises (still) run on mainframes. From telcos to retailers to
financial services to insurance companies, a large percentage of data sets originate from mainframe systems. However,
mainframe computing is an expensive affair --
for a typical enterprise, the computation costs can quickly become prohibitive. In addition, storing data on mainframes
is very expensive; all this high cost of storage and processing means that a large majority of data residing in
mainframes go unprocessed, missing opportunities to deliver insights for the data-driven enterprise.

Given that computing on mainframes is very expensive, enterprises are migrating their data processing tasks to
Hadoop; http://cascading.io[Cascading] is often the development platform used for their
applications. Cascading provides a simplified API which makes developing robust programs for Hadoop extremely easy.
Developers can easily test and debug their programs before taking them to production. Using Driven, they can improve
visibility into all stages of their application development.

In Cascading, the application logic is decoupled from where the data originates or finds its final destination. All
data formats intended for parsing are defined in http://docs.cascading.org/cascading/2.5/userguide/html/ch03s05.html[Taps].
In this tutorial, we will parse an http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC[EBCDIC] Cobol Copybook file generated by a
mainframe. To do that, we will implement a new http://docs.cascading.org/cascading/2.5/javadoc/cascading/scheme/Scheme.html[Scheme]
 to be used by our existing Cascading file tap. The structure of this data is represented by Copybook text files
containing Cobol code. Given a copybook, it is possible to parse the data from the EBCDIC stream.

NOTE: The mainframe input data used in this tutorial was generated randomly by another program. It is not actual 
customer data.  

In this tutorial, we
will develop a parser for translating one specific set of copybooks. Next, we will use the parser in a Cascading
application to read sample data and display its contents on the screen. Along the way, we will also view the application
in Driven, which can offer unique insight into the application's performance.

== Code Details

=== Solution Architecture and End to End Flow

This tutorial is an illustration on how to use Cascading for reading data generated by Mainframes. The application will
work with offline data--the application doesn't connect directly to a mainframe computer, but assumes that the data has
been exported from the mainframe to a platform where Cascading jobs are being executed.
The following diagram shows in yellow the typical steps that the mainframe's operator has to perform in order to prepare
 the data for processing by Cascading.

=== Discussion about Mainframe Data Format

The code for this tutorial can be divided into two broad components:

1. Set of classes for handling the low level parsing of copybooks.
2. Classes specific to Cascading--scheme, fields, etc., which use the parser classes.

The classes responsible for the low level translation were generated offline using Legstar and were imported into the
project for completeness. In production applications, these classes will be imported as a jar dependency.

Let's first see how we generated the parsers using Legstar

=== Parser Code Generation

*Step 1:* Translate COBOL copybooks to XML schemas and Java beans

As explained earlier, the structure of the data is represented by Cobol Copybooks. To translate these
structures into Java classes. For this tutorial, we make use of the open source http://www.legsem.com/legstar/[Legstar]
project to do this translation. LegStar is a set of development tools and execution runtimes aimed at integrating legacy
COBOL applications with Java and SOA technologies.

Legstar's utility "cob2trans" can translate Cobol copybooks into XML Schemas. The generated XML schemas contain COBOL
annotations that keep back references from each XML element to the originating COBOL item. The COBOL-annotated XML schemas
are then processed via JAXB <link>. LegStar has a JAXB plugin that propagates the original COBOL annotations to the Java beans
that JAXB generates. Once JAXB classes are produced, cob2trans invokes the Java compiler and then creates an additional
set of classes called binding classes. These classes are key to the COBOL to Java transformation runtime performances--they
avoid the cost of reflection at runtime.

We have done this step offline, but have provided the resulting Java beans classes in the beans subpackage. 


*Step 2:* Translate XML Schemas to Cascading Fields

Cascading models the data stream as a series of records, with each record containing one or more Fields. You can think of
Fields as the columns in a database table. In step 1 we were able to parse the copybooks and create XML schemas and Java bean
classes from it. We now need to convert the Cobol annotated XML schemas into Cascading Field classes. The source code for the
translator classes is present in the "translate" package. We invoked the Cob2Fields translator and placed
the resulting Field classes in the fields subpackage.

For instance, here's one of the copybooks converted offline to a Fields class:

[source, java]
----
public class Kc3ogp03 extends Fields
  {

  private static final long serialVersionUID = -1L;

  public Kc3ogp03()
    {
    super(
      new Comparable[]{
        "Ogp03TaxReliefTypeInd"
        , "Ogp03Earner"
        , "Ogp03TaxcertHeld"
        , "Ogp03VatMarker"
        , "Ogp03PartiesToAccount"
        , "Ogp03IntCertIss"
        , "Ogp03OresCode"
      }, new Type[]{
        short.class
        , short.class
        , java.lang.String.class
        , short.class
        , short.class
        , short.class
        , short.class
      }
    );
    }

  }
----


Now that we have the code generated for low level parsing of the copybooks, let's use it to build a Cascading Scheme.
In a typical application, the code generated by the steps performed so far will be bundled as a jar, and the application
building and using the scheme will have a dependency on it. For the purposes of this tutorial, in order to keep things simple,
we have provided the classes in their source code form.

=== Cascading Scheme and Client Code

*Step 1:* Create a Cascading Scheme

A http://docs.cascading.org/cascading/2.5/javadoc/cascading/scheme/Scheme.html[Scheme] in Cascading represents the
format of the data an application is trying to read or write. Given that we
are able to parse the cobol copybooks and translate them into Cascading Field classes, we are now in a position to develop
our scheme.

Let's examine the constructor of the Scheme class:

[source, java]
----

    private static final Bdfo27Config bdfo27Config = new Bdfo27Config();

    public Bdfo27Scheme()
      {
      super( Fields.merge(
      new Fields( "BdfoKey" ),
      Fields.merge( bdfo27Config.getFields().values()
        .toArray( new Fields[ bdfo27Config.getFields().size() ] ) ) ) );
      }
----

In the code shown above, we first instantiate a helper class Bdfo27Config which is a container for all the beans and fields
specific to our copybooks. For some other copybook, the generated bean and field classes will be different, and this container
will hold other beans. You can easily modify this class for your particular use case. In the scheme's constructor we use the
Bdfo27Config object to discover the fields specific to this copybook, and append them to the account key field.

The main processing logic of the Bdfo27Scheme is encapsulated in the Source method which is responsible for accepting one
input at a time, and converting it to a Cascading Tuple instance.

*Step 2:* Use the Scheme to Read Mainframe Data and Display Results

Now that we have the parser and the scheme, we are ready to wire everything together and create a simple app which reads
a sample EBCIDC coded data and prints the values of some of the fields on the screen. Let's take a look at the source code
of the class app.Main.

In Cascading, data connectivity is provided with Taps. A Tap can read or write data according to the Scheme it is bound with.
With the Bdfo27Scheme, we first create an input tap to read the EBCDIC encoded copybook data:

[source,java]
----
    String path = args[ 0 ];
    Tap<Properties, InputStream, OutputStream> inTap = new FileTap(new Bdfo27Scheme(), path );
----

Next, we create an output tap to print the values of some select fields on the screen. The sample data contains a lot of
fields, but we will select and display the value of only some of them. The fields of interest are passed in to the constructor
of the TextDelimited scheme, which is a class to print fields separated by a character separator. In this case, we use comma
as the separator character. Note that while we used the Bdfo27Scheme to read data, we are using the in-built Cascading scheme,
TextDelimited for output.

[source,java]
----
    SinkTap<Properties, OutputStream> outTap =
             new StdOutTap(new TextDelimited( new Fields( "BdfoKey", "Kcp01V05Sname",
            "Kcp01V05BicIndclass", "Kcp02V05TransfFromSortCode",
            "Kcp07V05BalIdent_0", "Kcp07V05Bal_0",
            "Kcp07V05BalIdent_1", "Kcp07V05Bal_1" ), true, "," ) );
----

Finally, we connect these two taps using a copy pipe, create the flow and execute it:

[source,java]
----
    Pipe copyPipe = new Pipe( "testPipe" );
    FlowDef flowDef = FlowDef.flowDef().addSource( copyPipe, inTap )
      .addTailSink( copyPipe, outTap )
      .setDebugLevel( DebugLevel.VERBOSE );

    FlowConnector flowConnector = new LocalFlowConnector();
    flowConnector.connect( flowDef ).complete();
----

Executing this flow will read the data file which was generated randomly, and print the contents of some of its fields
on the screen. The fields shown are the account key, followed by some transaction details. While we are only printing
the field values on the screen, you can easily proceed with complex data manipulation tasks after you're able to connect
to the EBCDIC data as shown in this tutorial. Cascading has a wealth of in-built data processing primitives such as
joins, group-by, etc which can express any custom data processing logic.

== What's next?

This tutorial was a quick introduction to the world of mainframe data and we showed you how you can process EBCDIC data
using a robust and scalable framework like Cascading. Using the legstar tool, you can create parser code and then develop
the Cascading scheme for your copybook formats.

To understand what you can do next after ingesting the data, we encourage you to try out the ETL tutorial.
