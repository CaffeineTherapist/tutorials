= Java Developers Guide to ETL with Cascading

== Part 4: Implement Count and “Top 10” aggregation function
 
=== What you will see
In Part 4 of the tutorial, we will count the number of occurrences of IP addresses, and report the top 10 IP addresses. 
In order to perform this 
operation, we will first group and sort the records (similar to previous 
exercise). Then, apply the 'Count' function and retain the top 
10 records using the Limit function.
 
=== Run and Validate Your Program
 
*Step 1:* Compile your program
 
[source,bash]
----
$ cd etl-log/part4
$ gradle clean jar
----

*Step 2:* If you have not done it already from the Part 1, copy the log file to Hadoop:
 
[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop dfs -mkdir /logs 
$ hadoop dfs -put ../data/NASA_access_log_Aug95.txt /logs
----
 
*Step 3:* Run your ETL flow
 
    $ hadoop jar ./build/libs/etl.jar /logs/NASA_access_log_Aug95.txt /output
 
*Step 4:* View the execution of your ETL flow in real-time through Driven

Depending on how you configured your Driven Plugin, either click the Driven 
URL from your console or log into the Driven application.

*Step 5:* View contents of the result file that contain the top 10 commonly 
referred IP addresses in the input file
 
    $ hadoop fs -cat /output/part-00000
 
=== What’s Going On?
 
We will only cover the parts in the code that are different from the previous section.

[source,java]
----
// Count occurences of each IP, and store them in field IPcount
Pipe countByIpPipe = new Pipe( "countByIpPipe", transformPipe );
countByIpPipe = new GroupBy( countByIpPipe, new Fields( "ip" ) );
countByIpPipe = new Every( countByIpPipe, Fields.GROUP, new Count( new Fields( "IPcount" ) ), Fields.ALL );
 
// Sort by IPcount
Pipe sortedCountByIpPipe = new Pipe( "sortedCountByIpPipe", countByIpPipe );
sortedCountByIpPipe = new GroupBy( sortedCountByIpPipe, new Fields( "IPcount" ), true );
 
// Create a sortedCountByIpPipe using Each and Retain to limit to top 10 results
sortedCountByIpPipe = new Each( sortedCountByIpPipe, new Fields( "IPcount" ), new Limit( 10 ) );
