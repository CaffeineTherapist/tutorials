This is a fast-paced tutorial which shows the most commonly used constructs in Scalding to build 
data applications. There are five parts in this tutorial, with each part building on the former.

### Part 1: Data Parsing and Cleaning

* Filter data to exclude it from processing (bad data)

### Part 2: Stream Splitting
* Separate data into two streams for processing

### Part 3: Data Operations on Stream 1
* Perform data operations on Stream 1 using Filters, Unique and Discard 

### Part 4: Data Operations on Stream 2
* Perform data operations on Stream 2 using a custom function

### Part 5: Join and Group By
* Join Stream 1 and Stream 2
