= Java Developers Guide to ETL with Cascading

== Part 3: Merging multiple data sources in an ETL flow
 
=== What You Will See
In Part 3 of the tutorial, we will have a automatically merge record
from multiple input files (using 'MultiSourceTap'), and then sort them by IP address.
 
This capability becomes important when you are implementing the following 
design patterns: 

* Globbing time-series files stored in different directories 
(as we did in Part 1 of the tutorial) 
* Importing multiple-files with different schemas to do a Join (covered in 
Part 6)

=== Run and Validate Your Program
 
*Step 1:* Compile your program
 
[source,bash]
----
$ cd etl-log/part3
$ gradle clean jar
----

*Step 2:* To run the Cascading ETL flow in Hadoop pseudo-distributed mode, 
copy the input log file to Hadoop

[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop dfs -put ../data/NASA_access_log_Aug95_head_5k.txt /logs 
$ hadoop dfs -put ../data/NASA_access_log_Aug95_tail_5k.txt /logs
----

*Step 3:* Run your ETL flow
 
    $ hadoop jar ./build/libs/etl.jar /logs/NASA_access_log_Aug95_head_5k.txt /logs/NASA_access_log_Aug95_tail_5k.txt /output
 
*Step 4:* View the execution of your ETL flow in real-time through Driven

Depending on how you configured your Driven Plugin, either click the 
Driven URL from your console or log into the Driven application.
 
[source,bash]

*Step 5:* View contents of the merged tab-separated data

Validate that the rows are sorted by IP address (in descending order)*
 
    $ hadoop fs -cat /output/part-00000
 
=== What’s Going On?
 
We will only cover the parts in the code that are different from the previous section.
 
The _cascading.tap.hadoop.GlobHfs_ tap accepts Hadoop style "file globbing" 
expression patterns -- this allows for multiple paths to be used as a single 
source, where all paths match the given pattern. This tap is only available 
when running on the Hadoop platform.

[source,java]
----
GlobHfs inTap1 = new GlobHfs( new TextLine(), inputPath1 ); 
GlobHfs inTap2 = new GlobHfs( new TextLine(), inputPath2 );
----

The _cascading.tap.MultiSourceTap_ is used to tie multiple tap instances into 
a single tap for use as an input source. All of the tap instances 
passed to the new MultiSourceTap must share the same schema

[source,java]
----
MultiSourceTap sourceTap = new MultiSourceTap( inTap1, inTap2 );
----

_GroupBy_ performs a union and an order by.  The output is grouped by a provided fields. 
The last boolean parameters indicates if the stream is to be sorted.

[source,java]
----
//Sort them by IP address 
processPipe = new GroupBy( processPipe, new Fields( "ip" ), true );
----
