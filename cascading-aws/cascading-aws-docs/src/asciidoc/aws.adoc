= Data Processing on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

== AWS Setup

Setup AWS and Redshift
----------------------

In this tutorial we will create end-to-end data processing workflows using the following AWS products:

* AWS Command Line Interface - http://aws.amazon.com/cli/
* AWS S3 - http://aws.amazon.com/s3/
* AWS Redshift - http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/
* AWS Elastic MapReduce - http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/

=== AWS

If you have not done so already, please signup and create an http://aws.amazon.com/[AWS account]

NOTE: This tutorial does not cover starting up a Redshift Database, AWS permission rules, and
general EC2 management. See the http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/[Redshift Documentation] and
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html[AWS CLI Documentation]
for further details.

=== Redshift
Launch a Redshift cluster by
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/rs-gsg-prereq.html[completing the 
Getting Started Guide]. Note down the JDBC URL, the database user name, the
database password and region. You will need them later.

Also note down your https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential[AWS
Security Credentials].

Since Redshift reads the data initially from S3, you have to provide the
AWS access-key/secret-key combination obtained from the previous step.

Reminder, if you have not done so already, please compile cascading-jdbc-redshift by supplying your Redshift
connection information to gradle build:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd ./[PATH]/[TO]/cascading-jdbc
$ gradle build -Dcascading.jdbc.url.redshift='jdbc:postgresql://[REDSHIFT_HOST]/[REDSHIFT_DB]?user=[USERNAME]&password=[PASSWORD]' -i
----

NOTE: Please ensure that your Redshift security group will accept traffic from
exteranl instances. Redshift uses port 5439. For the purposes of this tutorial we
have added a Custom TCP rule to allow all traffic to port 5439.

=== AWS Command Line Interface
Next, install and configure
http://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS Command Line Interface].
The AWS CLI is a unified tool that provides a consistent interface for interacting with all parts of AWS.
With it we can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.


[source,bash]
----
# ensure python installation
$ python --version
Python 2.7.5
----

[source,bash]
----
# download cli
$ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
# unzip
$ unzip awscli-bundle.zip
# install
$ sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
# verify install
$ aws help
# configure to your aws account - ensure that the default region is the same your Redshift cluster
$ aws configure
# if you have any S3 buckets you should now be able to list them like so:
$ aws s3 ls
